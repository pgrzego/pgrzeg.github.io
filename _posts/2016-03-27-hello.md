I needed to choose a solution. I have finally decided to set up a blog and I wanted to start writing posts. So I sat in front of my PC knowing one thing: **I don't have much time on my hands right now**. This lead me to three requirements for the solution I wanted to choose:

 1. It had to be something I knew or something I wouldn't spend much time to learn how to use.
 2. It had to be hosted on a reliable platform (no self-hosting).
 3. It had to have syntax highlighting.

*Setting up something customized costs time. Learning how to do so costs even more.* 
Therefore one of the first ideas that came to my mind - Wordpress - was thrown away immediately. I needed something simple and Wordpress is as complex as it gets nowadays. Don't get me wrong. I'm sure I would be able to handle it. And I'm sure it's full of plug-ins and templates which are awesome for a person who wants to have an amazing blog. But I like to know how stuff that I use works and at this moment I just don't have time. It had to wait.
It didn't take me too much time to stumble on GitHub pages. And it seemed to have it all:

 1. Hosted on GitHub servers (if I trust them with my code I can trust them with my blog).
 2. Markup syntax (I got to know it by writing readme files).
 3. Syntax highlighting.
 4. On top of that it comes with Bootstrap to support responsive layouts.
 5. Jekyll for post processing.

I found a sweet manual written by [Barry Clark](http://www.barryclark.co/) on one of my favorite web sites (Smashing Magazine) and I got it started. So far so good, so welcome and I invite you to comment anything you see here - I don't consider myself the smartest person ever and I'm sure things I do can be done better and if so I would actually like to know how :)

Let's start this adventure...
