I've always believed that generic functions of each language should be faster than any equivalent I would write myself. So for example I will choose [native sorting PHP methods](https://secure.php.net/manual/fr/array.sorting.php) instead of writing my own. And this should be the first step to ensure that the code runs as quick as possible. But the choice of an algorithm may greatly affect how quick the application will be. I know, it is kind of obvious. Anyway, here is a good read on how much this choice may have an impact: [What I learned from writing six functions that all did the same thing](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/what-i-learned-from-writing-six-functions-that-all-did-the-same-thing-b38fd48f0d55).
