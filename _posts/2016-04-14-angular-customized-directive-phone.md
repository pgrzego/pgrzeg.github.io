It seems that knowing `$scope` is the first step to understand **AngularJS**. One of the next ones is how to create your own **directive** which will turn a custom HTML tag into a complex HTML DOM structure. I've been assigned with a task like that. And it wasn't as easy as I expected, especially once I had to take a step towards even more complex use case. Let's start where I've started - from a ready directive which was waiting for me to change it (well I won't be talking about the exact same case, but similar enough). In one of the following posts I will describe what I did to answer additional requirement to introduce variables inside `comment` attribute.

### Beforehand

If you're not sure if you know enough about Angular JS, check out [Matthew Carriere's post "Controllers, Directives, and Services. AngularJS 101"](http://matthewcarriere.com/2015/01/13/controllers-directives-services-angularjs-101/).

----------

## The use case

There is a web page which is a showcase of mobile phone models. But the content of each module depends on the user who is logged in. Let's say the selection and comments depend on whether you are a premium customer or not. 

## The template

The module is designed as an Angular JS template. Which makes it easier later to reuse it in an HTML code. Here it is:

```html
<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8">
    <div class="panel panel-{{color}}">
        <div class="panel-heading">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xs-3">
                    <img height="128" src="{{photo}}"/>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-9">
                    <h2>First place: <strong>{{model}}</strong></h2>
                    <div>
                        {{comment}}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

    </div>
</div>
```

As you can see it uses [Boilerplate](https://getbootstrap.com/) and there are four variables:

 - color of the module;
 - photo of the phone;
 - model of the phone;
 - comment on the phone.

This one will be saved as `customTpl.html` (you will see this file name later in the directive).

## HTML page

We can now use a custom HTML tag which will set all these parameters:

```html
<phone modelid="3" photo="http://icongal.com/gallery/download/179985/256/png" color="warning" comment="The biggest DPI makes its screen crystal clear."></phone>
```

These are hard coded, but later on we will learn how to get them dynamically via AJAX calls.
What we need now is a directive to bind these two.

## The directive

I'll start with a code and I will explain what it does right after:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
app.directive('phone', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    replace: true,
    scope: {
      'comment': '@',
      'color': '@',
      'modelid': '@',
      'photo': '@'
    },
    templateUrl: 'customTpl.html',
    controller: function($scope) {
      fakeResponse = {
        "data": {
          "success": true,
          "model": "X300"
        }
      }
      $scope.model = fakeResponse.data.model;
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Replace
`Replace` let's us tell Angular to replace the element with the template that we are providing few lines below. In our case it means that the entire `<phone>` element will be removed and in its place there will be something else. Quick explanation about it can be found in [this answer on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27042336/basic-difference-between-transclude-true-and-replace-true-in-angular-js). There are more ways of how the final DOM will look like - `transclude` option is handy for that and [Eric Greene wrote an excellent post on that: Understanding Transclusion in AngularJS](https://www.accelebrate.com/blog/angularjs-transclusion-part-1/). 

## Scope
Now this seemed to be like a separate branch of science. I've read a two pretty good answers on Stack Overflow: [What is the difference between & vs @ and = in angularJS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14908133/what-is-the-difference-between-vs-and-in-angularjs) and [AngularJS : What is the difference between '@' and '=' in directive scope](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14050195/angularjs-what-is-the-difference-between-and-in-directive-scope). But they didn't explain it to me in an easy way. But maybe it's because I love examples. So it was much easier for me to understand it when I read [Dhananjay Kumar's post Understanding scopes in AngularJS custom Directives](http://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/dhananjay_kumar/archive/2015/06/11/understanding-scopes-in-angularjs-custom-directives.aspx) (event though there are some problems with a syntax highlighter that he is using). And there is [more extensive post written by Dan Wahlin: Creating Custom AngularJS Directives Part 2 â€“ Isolate Scope](https://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/creating-custom-angularjs-directives-part-2-isolate-scope).

I hope that after reading these you will be able to see what is happening here. We create an isolated `scope` which takes three values from the element's attributes. Two important factors which resulted in choosing `@` annotation:
1. We will use these values only here in this directive. Even if we changed them here, we wouldn't need to inform controller about it. This means it is a one way binding where if controller changes the value, the directive will know about it, but not vice versa.
2. We will use these values as strings. Even if they were declared as for example {% raw %} `color="{{$scope.variable_name}}"` {% endraw %}, the directive would get only the resulting string which is stored by controller in `$scope.variable_name`.

Now since these values are retrieved, they become a part of our directive's scope and therefore are available to use inside our template. It is rendered in place of the custom HTML tag. Which is a nice way to simplify templates and make them more flexible.


## Further reading

While working on this one I've stumbled across some very good questions and answers which were not directly related, but helped me expand my knowledge more:

1. Should you need to notify Angular that the `scope` was updated which is somehow explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16066170/angularjs-directives-change-scope-not-reflected-in-ui). 
2. If you want to support default values and additional tags [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10629238/angularjs-customizing-the-template-within-a-directive) should be useful.
3. [This plunker](http://jsbin.com/acibiv/4/edit) is a good example for recursive directives. I found it in the comments for [this post](https://sporto.github.io/blog/2013/06/24/nested-recursive-directives-in-angular/).
