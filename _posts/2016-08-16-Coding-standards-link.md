I was looking for a quick tip on how to make sure that PHP Storm will help me keep my coding standard in accordance with PSR and I found [a post by Matthew Setter on this topic](http://www.matthewsetter.com/enforcing-psr1-and-psr2-with-phpstorm/). As he writes:

> Good coding standards can make us better developers
> Good coding standards make our code more readable
> Good coding standards make our code shareable with other developers

Can't argue with that.
