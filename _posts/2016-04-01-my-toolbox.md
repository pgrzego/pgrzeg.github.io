title: My toolbox
---
There are so many great tools available for any developer that it is hard to choose from. It takes a bit of time to play around with a new one to see if it suits your needs. And after you configure it and get used to it, it may be hard to check a new one as it will force you to change your habits. So for anyone who just sets up his/hers environment, here are is my toolbox and why I chose it:

# Editors #
In the old days I had only three requirements for an editor:
1. Syntax highlighting
2. Charset convertion (being Polish I had to strugle with ISO-8859-2, latin-2 and UTF-8)
3. Built-in FTP client (so I was able to edit files directly on the server - totally unprofiessional right now, but well...)

That's it. I didn't want any other support. I felt like I was in total control of the code that way. And my choice was PSPad which was able to do all of that for me.
